Digital Signal Processing projects covering modulation (BPSK, QPSK, QAM), AWGN channels, FDMA/CDMA, voice FFT analysis, filtering, and quantization (uniform, A-Law, μ-Law). Includes full MATLAB/Simulink communication chains and core concepts for wireless and IoT physical-layer systems.

Digital Signal Processing & Digital Communications — MATLAB / Simulink

This repository contains a collection of graduate-level projects focused on Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Digital Communications, implemented using MATLAB and Simulink. The work covers key concepts used in modern wireless systems, low-power communications, and physical-layer analysis.

1. Digital Modulation

Implementation and simulation of BPSK, QPSK, and QAM modulation schemes. The modules include constellation diagrams, symbol mapping, demodulation, BER vs. SNR curves, and performance evaluation under AWGN channels to understand noise impact on digital signals.

2. FDMA and CDMA Multiplexing

Modeling and comparison of FDMA and CDMA multi-user systems. The project analyses channel separation, interference behavior, spectral efficiency, and the advantages and limitations of each multiplexing technique.

3. Voice Signal Analysis

Processing of recorded vowel signals using:

FFT spectral analysis

Low-pass filtering

Time- and frequency-domain comparison
This section explores how filtering, noise, and frequency content affect speech quality and digital representation.

4. Quantization Techniques

Implementation of:

Uniform quantization

A-Law and μ-Law companding

Reconstruction error evaluation using MSE
These modules illustrate how quantization resolution and non-linear compression influence digital voice coding and signal quality.

5. End-to-End Digital Communication Chains

Complete transmitter/receiver pipelines including:

Modulation

Noise injection

Filtering

Signal reconstruction

Performance visualization through spectrograms, FFTs, and constellation diagrams
